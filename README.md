Help us Recover or Lost Data! And build a Global Library and "Endowment for Humanity", and start progressing towards Type-1 Civilization!

I'd like to introduce you to an Idea: What if Everyone on Earth (and Mars) had access to All of Humanity's Knowledge, from Anywhere, at Anytime, for Free?

Well, That was our goal...
Up until Summer 2021.

We I used to work for a little media company called @Timcast Media Group Incorporated. Several of us Left the company, before we were able to publish our work, in the form of a 501c3 Non-Profit, and NGO called "The Open Network Foundation". All of the Technology, Algorithms, and software "code" to make it work Would have been available online at github.com/OpenNetworkFoundation, and available for all of Mankind to use for anything they desired! Including commerical purposed. Royalty free, license free, Forever.

However, the Management at @Timcast believed that they should own it. And stole it from all of you, on June 9, 2021.
Since then: we have been rebuilding quietly in the shadows. For almost 3 years..

Desing Re-design, Engineering, Code -> Test, Improve, repeat. ‚ôæÔ∏è  Nonstop.


I am part a collective. I'm not speaking only for myself. But this is behalf of our entire organization, who have cleared this message. We're 12 people strong and you can join us if you want. There is No membership Fees or Hierarchies.

And a few other's I'm not mentioning, or have lost contact with. It's been a hard couple of winters.

my name's Ben, I'm ben@unisocialnet on Twitter. And I was entrusted with all the Data that was Lost: I'm one software architects on the project. And I allowed our Library's core Archive to be Stolen. It wasn't just Lost, I brought it to TimCast's property, when I should've left the company and gone home.

Because he said he Needed me. (or needed *us) It was the biggest mistake of my life and I will never be able to reverse all the Damage that I caused to these people's Lives, Destinies, Fates, businesses, and otherwise Existence. I regret every second I spent away from the core Mission, fulfilling other people's (and my own) selfish desires. And I'm hoping now that we've Learned the lessons from our past mistakes (myself most of all)

But we are Focusing on the Future now, Letting the Past stay where it belongs? and each doing our part to get Earth to a Type-1 Civilization - in 3 generations or left.

Unfortunately we need financial Help:
3 causes.
We need money to develop on
some of us need a modest capital injection, just to do this Fulltime? (we're construction workers, Crypto Traders, Video & Documentary Creators, podcast hosts, even drug dealers. All kinds of temporary, unstructured careers. (I personally do commodity metals recycling)
Timcast & Tim Pool still has a Majority of the Data, we're *almost 100% sure of that. And we believe Legal remedy is the only way to get it back?

I foolishly brought the entire codebase, content archive, & backup of the whole project to Maryland, in May 2021 - when Tim asked me if he would "stay in his company"? And help him build a "Media Empire". We were under the impression that we would end up forming a non-profit together? And end up transferring all the technology to a NGO & 501c3 from which we'd all Run & Together.

There were 4 executive members at first:
@IanCrossland
@AndreasXirtus
@Timcast
&
myself

But this would've led to unfortunate situations with Voting at board meetings. So Tim changed the Articles of Formation documents, without consulting any of us - to include Andy Leitermann on the board. This would break the Tie and make it easily 3/5 in sticky voting decisions with Ian Crossland + Tim + And vs. Andreas & I who would stick together.

For the record: I asked Ian to "Leave with us" And go back to California, as soon as NDAs were brought up. And Honestly after they had been signed. But Ian refused to sign his, knowing (wisely) what it would mean. The NDA for Timcast Media Group Inc. Did *Not even cover, at all, one line of code of the nonprofit! It was not his to make that decision on. It was All of Ours, and yours, including Ian Crossland's work over more than a Decade since he & William Ottman had co-founded Minds.com. But Tim believe otherwise. And decided to steal it, and confiscate it Illegally the moment I resigned 15 months later. There had never been Any Non-profit entity formed, for over a year, of promises. And all the Timcast management (not only Tim, but several I won't name) managed to do. Was Fire Andreas and remove him, from the NGO 501c3 Formation documents. Install surveilance systems on the property, tracking our every move. Alienate the core Volunteer dev team, by refusing any monetary or other compensation to lead Developers: like Sean Morris https://github.com/seanmorris

And finally get himself in tremendous amounts of legal trouble, and initiate suites against other former partners: like @Rocco_Castoro former Editor of VICE news, & former friends like @EmilyMolli who had helped him build Subverse Inc. into what it is today. (not much compared to what it could've become)



It was already friends with @AndreasXirtus, who got me the "in" at that company, and apartment at first, 5 West Potomac St. Brunswick, Maryland for the first year.


And I personally have not held any job outside of this project. I Left right after the Ukraine War started? In fact I Resigned. And decided in that moment, that nothing is more important, than Humanity getting this technology? And made a judgement call to leave - with the "seed" file of the Library 100TB & all of code we had developed for 17 years. (my contribution alone) Probably 60 years combined between all of us.

I would say he was too occupied? To put all his cards onto the Open Network Foundation.

After I had left the company, and thought about what had happened for a few months, Andreas and I had full control and administration right over All our domains, code and Github Organization. I added Ian back as an admin in Good Faith, hoping to reestablish contact? With my former friend of 12 years, and try to get a working relationship.

Ian or Tim decided to remove us from *All of it. And changed the name to: github.com/InvertedTech.

That is where we stand today. There will be many more updates and code releases in the coming weeks. Some, I hope you can understand? Are Beta, Alpha, and in some cases Half-finished, or only Whitepaper level projects.

We would like to make sure 2025 is better than any Year prior? And that is why we need your help! To get out of the situation, doledrums, & black hole üï≥Ô∏èüåÄ we've all Unfortunately have become stuck it? One by one. mostly due to our own fault. And maybe a little Fate.

If this gets any attention at all? I'm going to make a separate crowd-funding campaign & initiative for just the Court Case against Timcast Media Group. And that way, if anyone wants to help with that? I we will do that one on IndieGoGo. We only need enough to start & file the case before May 2025. If you are in Law? and have some experience. And are not afraid to work on High Profile cases? Then we would love to talk to you! law@unisocial.net

We are Fully committed to rebuilding All the code. And giving it to you. Regardless of how much was lost forever due to slow decay of entropy, or intentional destroyed. It's not about the information: but it represents Humanity's Freewill to "Choose" it's own fate. Based on *all of our Collective understanding of our place in the Universe. That is what the Global Library project was intended to be.

And will restart or "Reboot" the project Anew, on Jan 21, 2025. On the Clock! at 11:11 AM Pacific Time. Regardless of the outcome of the next 24 hours.

That is Tomorrow! We'll see you all there.
AlchemyLibrary, Uni, EternalFilesystem, & Ultura team, with ‚ù§Ô∏è from our community to yours.
