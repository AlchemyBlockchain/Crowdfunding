Help us Recover or Lost Data! And build a Global Library and "Endowment for Humanity", and start progressing towards Type-1 Civilization!

I'd like to introduce you to an Idea: What if Everyone on Earth (and Mars) had access to All of Humanity's Knowledge, from Anywhere, at Anytime, for Free?

It's Happened before:

Richard C. Hoagland, Evidence of a Type II Civilization in our Solar System, Millions of Years ago
https://youtu.be/UHXH8jAUk64

Well, what if it was Possible Again?




That was our goal Too... Changing Humanity's Future, by Understanding the Past.




 Back down to Earth:
We were trying to establish a 501c3 Non-Profit, and NGO called "The Open Network Foundation". https://opennetwork.foundation

It would be a DAO too, as in a Cryptocurrency Project "Distributed Autonomous Organization", but unlike any else that exists. And the legal entities we were forming, were only to be able to pay peoples & developer's salaries or enough bug bounties so they'd be able to work full time.

All of the Technology, Algorithms, Mathematics, and software "code" to make it work Would have been available online at github.com/OpenNetworkFoundation, and available for all of Mankind - and Yours! For any fair use you desire. Including commerical purposed. Royalty free, license free in most cases. Creative Commons Forever. https://copyleft.org/

However, fate decided to intervene and it was not time for it yet. We all had to Learn a lot more Lessons first.

Desing Re-design, Engineering, Code -> Test, Improve, repeat. ♾️ Nonstop.


we need financial Help on 3 key Objectives.
We need money for New & "Bleeding Edge" Hardware to develop on. This includes even crypto miners in some circumstances (don't worry it will be accounted for, and some of us need a modest Financial Health injection, just to do this Fulltime? And get over that Verion 0.1 Barrier we're stuck at (we're construction workers, Crypto Traders, Video & Documentary Creators, Auto mechanics, Podcast hosts, even drug dealers. Every kind of of temporary, unstructured career you can Think of! (I personally came from Economics) And we may have to setup individual Funding campaigns for each person depending of Time committed.
Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately: Our former Employer still has a Majority of the Data, we're *almost 100% sure of that. And we believe Legal case & remedy is the only way to get it back? That would save us 3 or 4 years.
Let's just be Honest here: it's 2025? Humanity is F*ing Running Out of Time!


I'm part a collective. I'm not speaking only for myself. But as a representative behalf of our entire organization, who have cleared this message for release and stayed on board for 14 long years. We're on all habitable continents & websites, speak all major language famlies, use Your Favorite social networks. And You can join us if you want? To build this Together.

There is No membership Fees or barrier to entry or Hierarchies. All of the information is disclosed! Up front. Without limit. We are structured based around a set of Bylaws & doctrines, principles that we all have agreed are in Humanities best interest, which we are trying to embody each individially - a Collective encode: the into an A.I. Which would thereafter surpervise, consult, regulate, and Distribute the Endowment fund which maintains and supports the Library, as Humanity solves problems of government & scarcity on earth, and ventures out into space.

That is the Plan anyway. Trust the Plan. We do! Why Because? it is always changing transforming and adapting to new Requirements and conditions, as we enter a new age. The age of Aquarius. Like Water? It has to flow around Obstacles, and fit whatever Society, State function, or "The Matrix" that we inhabit - and operate within those constraints, So that we can

In terms of the Humans? We have 12 on the project so far.

And a few other's I'm not mentioning, or do not have permission from to mention. It's been a hard couple of years & winters. Very few of us actually live in the same cities? Currently we meet on Wire app and other encrypted communication technologies but we are hoping the Meta-verse concept solves distance issues? And build a better Internet AR/VR message exchange Layer? Let's start with just getting Telegram back to what it used to be, and a WhatsApp like open-source app using https://matrix.org's Protocol. But you can imagine what else technologically is possible? With these tiny powerful computing devices you are already holding in your hand.




my name's Ben, I'm ben at unisocial.net and "Uni" on Twitter. One of software guys. And I was entrusted with the Master Database & copy of all the projects Data & sources that we Lost: That was *My fault. I have to Own that mistake!

Well some of us used to work for a little media company called @Timcast Media Group Incorporated. Several of us Left the company, before we were able to publish our work.

The Management at @Timcast believed that they should own it? Instead of You and Humanity as a whole, for Political leverage and financial benefit. And expropriated the code & seed data on June 9, 2021. Since then: we have been rebuilding quietly in the shadows. For almost 3 years..

And I allowed our Library's core Archive to be Stolen. It wasn't just Lost, I brought it to TimCast's property, when I should've left the company and gone home.

Because he said he Needed me. (or needed *us) It was the biggest mistake of my life and I will never be able to reverse all the Damage that I caused to these people's Lives, Destinies, Fates, businesses, and otherwise Existence. I regret every second I spent away from the core Mission, fulfilling other people's (and my own) selfish desires. And I'm hoping now that we've Learned the lessons from our past mistakes (myself most of all)

But we are Focusing on the Future now, Letting the Past stay where it belongs? and each doing our part to get Earth to a Type-1 Civilization - in 3 generations or les.

I foolishly brought the entire codebase, content archive, & backup of the whole project to Maryland, in May 2021 - when Tim asked me if he would "stay in his company"? And help him build a "Media Empire". We were under the impression that we would end up forming a non-profit together? And end up transferring all the technology to a NGO & 501c3 from which we'd all Run & Together.

There were 4 executive members at first:
@IanCrossland
@AndreasXirtus
@Timcast
&
myself

However this would've led to unfortunate situations with Voting at board meetings. So Tim changed the Articles of Formation documents, without consulting any of us - to include Andy Leitermann on the board. This would break the Tie and make it easily 3/5 in sticky voting decisions with Ian Crossland + Tim + And vs. Andreas & I who would always stick together. They knew that.

For the record: I asked Ian to "Leave with us" And go back to California? To start this with our core Team, as soon as NDAs were brought up. And Honestly after they had been signed? But Ian refused to sign his, knowing (wisely) what it would mean. The NDA for Timcast Media Group Inc. Did *Not even cover, at all, one line of code of the nonprofit. It was not his to make that decision on. Yet. Because it had never been agreed to by the other partners and Trustees to give him access to such immense power.

It was All of Ours, and yours, Humanity's, including Ian Crossland's work over more than a Decade since he & William Ottman had co-founded Minds.com. But Tim believe otherwise. And decided to expropriate and confiscate it Illegally the moment I resignedr. There had never been Any Non-profit entity formed, for over a year of 3 months, of promises, and up to 100 Volunteers joining us and actively participating in our design meetings. Some even taking time away from family & work to dedicate hours of their lives to Code this idea into existance!

And all the Timcast management (not only Tim, but several I won't name) managed to do. Was Fire Andreas and remove him from the board, shred the 501c3 Formation documents and changed the bylaws significantly enough to "own" Us, by owning our time, and preventing outside employment & income streams, independent from his empire. Install surveilance systems on the property, tracking our every move. Alienate the core Volunteer dev team, by refusing any monetary or other compensation to lead Developers: like Sean Morris https://github.com/seanmorris

And get himself in tremendous amounts of legal trouble, and initiate $1.5 Million lawsuites against other former partners: like @Rocco_Castoro former Editor of VICE news, & former friends like @EmilyMolli who had helped him & Ian build Subverse Inc. into what it is today. (not much compared to what it could've become. We think that Chris has a story to tell on that, but that's his choice to or not) And other nefarious and sabotaging moves.

We will not discuss further, online, until a court date is set. Needless to say: Everyone is Human? and makes mistakes? Sometime we make them out of Fear, Anger, scarcity-mindset, or Paranoia? And Distrust. But it's part of Life & the Growing process, of the soul. 

And Everyone is entitled to a "2nd Change" and Redemption & Forgiveness. Even Tim, and his top allies, & lawyers Who made these decisions.

I would say he was too occupied? To put all his cards onto the Open Network Foundation? And that is understandable, given his immensely complex goals & Dream as well.

We don't think there any reason why even separately our projects can coexist and succeed. That is the way of Open-source. No-one "owns" it. Because Everyone does.


And I personally have not held any job outside of this project. I Left right after the Ukraine War started? In fact I Resigned. And decided in that month, February 22, 2022, that nothing is more important, than Humanity getting free from our current Bondage situation? That requires Technology. Knowledge. and Focused intent. And made a judgement call to leave - with the "seed" file of the Library 100TB & all of code we had developed for 17 years. (my contribution alone) Probably 60 years combined between all of us.

It was @AndreasXirtus, who got me the "in" at that company, and we kept all the data at our apartment in Brunswick, Maryland for the first 10 month.

After I had left the company, and thought about what had happened for a few months, Andreas and I had full control and administration right over All our domains, code and Github Organization. I added Ian back as an admin in Good Faith, hoping to reestablish contact? With my former friend of 12 years, and try to get a working relationship.

Ian or Tim decided to remove us from *All of it. And changed the name to: github.com/InvertedTech.

That is where we stand today. There will be many more updates and code releases in the coming weeks. Some, I hope you can understand? Are Beta, Alpha, and in some cases Half-finished, or only Whitepaper level projects.

We would like to make sure 2025 is better than any Year prior? And that is why we need your help! To get out of the situation, doledrums, & black hole ️ we've all Unfortunately have become stuck it? One by one. mostly due to our own fault. And maybe a little Fate.

If this gets any attention at all? I'm going to make a separate crowd-funding campaign & initiative for just the Court Case against Timcast Media Group. And that way, if anyone wants to help with that? I we will do that one on IndieGoGo. We only need enough to start & file the case before May 2025. If you are in Law? and have some experience. And are not afraid to work on High Profile cases? Then we would love to talk to you! [email redacted]

We are Fully committed to rebuilding All the code. And giving it to you. Regardless of how much was lost forever due to slow decay of entropy, or intentional destroyed. It's not about the information: but it represents Humanity's Freewill to "Choose" it's own fate. Based on *all of our Collective understanding of our place in the Universe. That is what the Global Library project was intended to be.

We classed this as and Education project, because the next 6 Months we'll be working almost entirely on releasing free University quality Courses & Directories on how to Understand, modify, Use, and even Create your own Technology.

"Reboot" the project Anew, on Jan 21, 2025. On the Clock! at 11:11 AM Pacific Time. Regardless of the outcome of the next 24 hours.

That is Tomorrow! We'll see you there. Thank You, All!
The AlchemyLibrary, EternalFilesystem, UniOS, & Ultura team, with ❤️ from our community to yours.

P.S. this would not be possible without Christina's help, care Love and Support, Give her some positive Energy too! (@TimeTravelPod🎙️)
